OBJECTIVE:

The objective of “Industry specific-intelligent fire management system” is to avoid the unintended fire accidents in industries and also take appropriate measures to avoid any mishap. The smart fire management system includes a Gas sensor, Flame sensor and temperature sensors to detect any changes in the environment. If any flame is detected the sprinklers will be switched on automatically. The model incorporates MQ2 gas sensor for detecting propane and methane gases, flame is detected by IR flame sensor module and LM35 Temperature Sensor for the measurement of the environment. These readings are monitored continuously by IBM Watson IOT Platform and stored in Cloudant DB. Based on the temperature readings and if any Gases are present, the exhaust fans are powered ON. In case any variation occurs, the authorities and fire station will be alerted via Fast2SMS web service. Emergency alerts are notified to the authorities and Fire station.
